# 📦 Amazon Sales Performance Dashboard

## 1. 🎯 The Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze multi-year Amazon sales data using Power BI to uncover sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.  
The analysis focuses on transforming raw transactional data into actionable insights that help improve product strategy, reduce losses, and optimize operations across regions.

This project answers critical business questions such as:

- How are sales performing over the years and months?  
- Which product categories and items generate the highest revenue and profit?  
- Which regions contribute most to sales and profitability?  
- What payment methods do customers prefer?  
- How do cancellations and returns impact total revenue?  

---

## 2. ❓ The Problem
Amazon faced challenges in understanding its long-term sales performance due to:

### **Data Issues & Operational Problems**
- High return and cancellation rates affecting net revenue.  
- Large product variety making it difficult to identify best- and worst-performing products.  
- Inconsistent regional performance requiring strategic focus.  
- Customer behavior variation (payment methods, purchase timing).  
- Limited visibility into salesperson performance and order-level details.

This analysis solves these issues by cleaning the data, modeling it properly, and visualizing key metrics in Power BI.
